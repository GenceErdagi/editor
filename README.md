# Markdown Preview 

This is an markdown preview that uses opentui markdown editor with custom flavor of tree-sitter. right now it is bare bones and uses built in markdown component but plans here is to create a custom rendering engine that will be able to edit the markdown in modular way and support the full github flavor markdown.
